### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project.

FuelStack is an innovative platform designed to democratize the use of blockchain technology. It simplifies buying and selling of both physical and digital goods, allowing transactions in any currency, be it traditional fiat or cryptocurrency. FuelStack also enables the easy creation, management, and sale of NFTs. It even provides the unique feature of porting NFTs between different blockchains. Designed for everyone from businesses to everyday consumers, FuelStack aims to be the universal translator for blockchain, removing technical barriers and opening up a new world of opportunities in a vast global marketplace.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.

The world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be intimidating for the uninitiated. The technical jargon, the complexity of the technology, and the uncertainty around how to navigate this new landscape can deter many potential users. FuelStack aims to remove these barriers by providing a platform that is as easy to use as any traditional e-commerce platform. The objective is to make blockchain technology as common and as simple to use as the internet is today. We wish to extend this simplicity to the VeChain Ecosystem to encourage new user adoption for the chain and to allow non technical customers to easily participate in the VeChain Ecosystem.

- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.


#### Overview

|  | Milestone 1 | Milestone 2 | Milestone 3 | Total |
| - | - |- | - | - |
| Estimated Duration | 30 d | 30 d | 30 d  | 90 d |
| Full-time equivalent (FTE) | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Cost (up to $ 30,000) | $ 10,000 | $ 10,000 | $ 10,000 | $ 30,000|

#### Milestone 1 — Additional Wallets

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 1| Account Creation | Work started by integrating the VeChain community to the platform by means of account creation. VeChain users can log into the platform, opening the doors to xSPECTAR. |
| 2 | Land Purchase | The ability to purchase land using the VeChain token. This step will allow the platform to request payments using the VeChain token as well as confirm the payments have been made. Only then will the purchase complete and the product be released to the buyer. |


#### Milestone 2  —  Initial Smart Contracts
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | NFT's | Creation of the base smart contract to mint and transfer NFTs as well as the base marketplace contracts to integrate the NFT’s into our platform |
| 2 | Extended Features | Additional features for smart contracts which will enable all platform users to be able to list their NFT’s without having to give express permission, saving on gas fees.  |
| 3 | Marketing | Initial tease marketing will be pushed out, mainly under the xSPECTAR brand to pull in new users from the VeChain and XRP communities. Comms will be small at first, letting the community know they can now login and buy xSPECTARverse land with VeChain tokens.  |


#### Milestone 3  —  NFT Collection Creation
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Base Smart Contract | Integrate the newly created “base smart contract” templates into the platform so that users can pick VeChain as a minting provider when issuing their NFTS. |
| 2 | Support | We will begin training up our support team about the new smart contracts, issuing wallets and other VeChain related network details. |


#### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce and publish at least one article/tutorial (e.g., on Medium). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

We recommended you provide social medium, like Twitter, Telegram group, or Reddit, on your website. When the developers/users need assistance, they could get in touch with you and get help.
